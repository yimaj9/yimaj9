      <h2>Abadir Plaza</h2>

      <p>
        Abadir Plaza is one of HARICON’s recent projects that combines both renovation and recreation. It covers 1.1 square meter of land, stretching from
        <strong>Asmadin Bari</strong> all the way to <strong>Bedri Bari</strong>—two of the iconic gates of Harar's old city.
      </p>

      <p>So, what is Abadir Plaza?</p>

      <p>
        For many years, the historic <strong>Jugel wall</strong> was hidden behind illegal structures and unplanned businesses that not only blocked the view but also posed a risk to the heritage site. With the support of the local government and the efforts of HARICON, these structures were cleared, and the walls were renovated—bringing back their original beauty and making them visible to everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right beside this restored section lies <strong>Abadir Plaza</strong>, built to serve as a modern public space for both locals and visitors. The plaza includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>children’s playground</strong></li>
        <li>A <strong>mini football field</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Relaxation areas</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Fountains</strong></li>
        <li>And other spaces designed for community enjoyment</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Construction began in <strong>January 2025</strong> and was completed by the same year</strong>. Today, Abadir Plaza stands as a symbol of progress—bringing people together while preserving the history of Harar. And It has a budget of 1,44757,092 Ethiopian Birr.
