  <h2>Jugel Street Renovation Project</h2>
  <p>Before renovation began on the Jugel streets — from Mohammed Ali to Bedri Beri Gate — the area faced major sanitation issues. Wastewater from homes was flowing directly on the ground due to the absence of a proper drainage system.</p>

  <p>To resolve this, we installed an underground drainage system that channels wastewater from every household into a concealed network of ditches. The old cobblestones were removed and replaced with new, durable paving stones to improve both the functionality and appearance of the Street</p>

  <p>We also opened the ditches and carried out the necessary maintenance and repairs to restore proper drainage flow.</p>

  <p>This renovation project covers a total area of <strong>2,500 square meters</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Current Progress:</strong> 12% complete</p>
  <p><strong>Estimated Completion:</strong> December 2025</p>
